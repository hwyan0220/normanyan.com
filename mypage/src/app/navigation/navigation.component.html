            Hi, Iâ€™m Norman.
        <br>
        <br>
            I'm a data scientist working in Westpac Bank. I create lots of cool stuffs to make our bankers and customers lives easier. 
        <br>
        <br>    
            I love my job so much as it's different everyday and gives me opportunities to create magical moments for people.
        <br>
        <br>
            I have worked on many different roles in my past, I have worked as an investment banker specialised in IPO deals, worked as a financial analyst who looks after a public company's pricing model and annual budget. 
        <br>
        <br>
            I was also deeply interested in quantitative trading which led me to create my own trading system and obtained my CFA designation. 
        <br>
        <br>    
            I enjoy explaining complex data science concepts to people and have taken a part-time teaching assistant role in Sydney Uni last sememster.
        <br>
        <br>
            Last but not least, I am also working hard on my research degree which I hope to finish in the next few years.
        <br>
        <br>
            Data science is the superpower of modern time and I'm super thankful that I had the chance to do things I love.

                              Led the development of Customer First Tool in Business Bank which serves as

                              Solely built the data foundation, established data pipeline/ETL to make sure
                              data flows smoothly, reliably and timely. Built client/server capabilities using
                              latest Angular/.Net Core technologies. Deployed a chatbot using IBM Watson to
                              facilitate customer support. We moved super fast with limited resources
                              (completed this great work within 4 mths, from wireframe to deployment)
