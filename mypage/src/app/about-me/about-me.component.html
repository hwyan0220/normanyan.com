          Hi, Iâ€™m Norman.

      <br>
      <br>
          I'm a data scientist working in Westpac Bank. I create lots of cool stuffs to make our bankers and customers lives easier. 
      <br>
      <br>    
          I love my job so much as it's different everyday and gives me opportunities to create magical moments for people.
      <br>
      <br>
          I have worked on many different roles in my past, I have worked as an investment banker specialised in IPO deals, worked as a financial analyst who looks after a public company's pricing model and annual budget. 
      <br>
      <br>
          I was also deeply interested in quantitative trading which led me to create my own trading system and obtained my CFA designation. 
      <br>
      <br>    
          I enjoy explaining complex data science concepts to people and have taken a part-time teaching assistant role in Sydney Uni last sememster.
      <br>
      <br>
          Last but not least, I am also working hard on my research degree which I hope to finish in the next few years.
      <br>
      <br>
          Data science is the superpower of modern time and I'm super thankful that I had the chance to do things I love.
